# Electric-Vehicle-Market-Segmentation-
The electric vehicle industry has undergone significant transformations in recent years, driven by changes in technology and consumer preferences. As with any emerging industry, the government plays a crucial role in shaping not only public perception but also the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) by the masses. 
The EV industry is moving at a fast pace in most of the countries, not only in terms of evolution of technology, but also in terms of government policy and consumer expectations. Studies conducted in the EV domain in the past will become less relevant soon due to the fast-evolving nature of the industry. Many studies have been conducted in the past on the Indian automobile industry or its traditional segments, but the literature on the EV industry in India is limited and fragmented. Most of the earlier studies attempted to understand consumer sentiments toward electrical vehicles in western developed countries and China. Few studies and reports focusing on understanding electric vehicle uptake were also conducted in the context of developed nations. In the past, only a few studies were conducted explaining consumer understanding and expectations toward EVs in the Indian context. A report focusing on consumer concerns for electric vehicles and understanding the factors affecting electric vehicle uptake was missing in the Indian context. Indian policy makers and industry professionals lacked much needed insight into the EV domain. The present report aims to bridge this glaring gap. This report will help EV Start-up policymakers and business professionals to understand Indian consumers’ concerns, which will help them design better policies and strategies to give a big boost to EV adoption by Indian consumers.
The data used for this study are obtain from EVIndia.csv (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kkhandekar/electric-vehicles-india) ‘Indian automobile buying behaviour study.csv’(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/karivedha/indian-consumers-cars-purchasing- behaviour).All official data from government of India related to EV data. (https://data.gov.in/search?title=Electric%20Vehicles)
The above website contains lots of datasets like a dataset which gives state-wise sales of EVs in India, another dataset which gives total number and types of EVs in India in both Transport Vehicles and Non-Transport Vehicles. Another dataset contains the state-wise count of EVs and total number of vehicles in that state etc.

The libraries that we have used for data pre-processing are as follows-
1)	Numpy
2)	Pandas
3)	Seaborn
4)	Matplotlib
5)	SVD

The SVD package is used to create an artificial dataset having similar statistical properties to the original dataset that we have. This is done so because the original dataset has very few data in it.
Once all these libraries were imported then we started understanding the datasets.
The dataset
‘RS_Session_254_AU_2384.C.i.csv’ contains the total number of EVs registered under
VAHAN4.0 based on their category and vehicle class. This dataset can be viewed as follows-

This dataset can be better understood by the help of various visualisations. The pie chart visualization of the dataset helped us to understand about the percentage of different vehicles under the Transport Vehicles as well as the Non-Transport Vehicles Category. The pie charts are given below-

From the above pie chart, it is clear that for all the EVs registered under Transport Vehicles about 90% of the registrations belongs to E-Rickshaws.

From the above pie chart, it can be clearly seen that from the non-transport vehicles M-Cycle / Scooter has had most EV registrations (80%) followed by Motor Car (9%), Moped (8%) etc.
The above data suggests that the start-up company should look towards manufacturing E- Rickshaws if it wants to manufacture Transport Vehicles or it should start manufacturing E- Scooters / Electric Cars if it wants to enter the market of manufacturing Non-Transport Vehicles.
The visualization of this dataset gave a lot of information related to the use and sale of EVs across states in India. This information is given below in terms of pie charts as follows –

we conclude that to create an Electric Vehicle startup in India, the most optimal market segment for us will be based on Geographic and Demographic segments which would be the most amount of EVS sold in particular states and the type of electric vehicle respectively.

After analysing the EV market using Market Segmentation Analysis, the feasible strategy that we have come up with is that we will be focussing on the states that have more demand for EVs like Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Karnataka, Maharashtra. Also, one more reason to set up the start-up in these 3 states is that the infrastructure required for the EVs including the charging station is available which would ease the burden in setting up of the start-up process and also the governments are providing a lot of subsidiaries to the people as well as for the company in order to encourage electric vehicles.
Also, the EV start-up company should focus on developing EV 2-Wheelers and SUVs in EV 4-wheelers which will help them get a good potential customer base according to our research and analysis and will help the company to grow in the early market.
